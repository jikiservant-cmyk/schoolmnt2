# Login / auth security audit (2026-10-05)

Covers the login, signup, session, logout and teacher-PIN flows, plus the
endpoints next to them. The dynamic tests live in `security/pentest/`.

## Dynamic test results

| # | Attack | Before | After |
|---|--------|--------|-------|
| 1 | **Forged session cookie:** a non-admin gets tokens directly from GoTrue with the public anon key and opens `/dashboard` | **VULNERABLE** (200) | Blocked (307 → `/login?error=access_denied`) |
| 2 | Same, against the `/mark-attendance` kiosk | **VULNERABLE** (200) | Blocked |
| 3 | Admin of another app in a shared Supabase project (`app_type=clinic`) logs in | **VULNERABLE** | Blocked |
| 4 | Brute force: 12 rapid password guesses | **VULNERABLE** (all processed) | Blocked at attempt 6 |
| 5 | Role enumeration: different error for "valid password but not admin" | **VULNERABLE** | One generic message |
| 6 | Cross-site `POST /api/logout` (CSRF) | **VULNERABLE** (303) | 403 |
| 7 | Session cookie `SameSite=None` | **VULNERABLE** | `SameSite=Lax` |
| 8 | Session cookie readable by JS (no HttpOnly) | **VULNERABLE** | `HttpOnly` |
| 9 | Login page can be framed (clickjacking) | **VULNERABLE** | `X-Frame-Options: DENY` + `frame-ancestors 'none'` |
| 10 | `X-Powered-By: Next.js` | **VULNERABLE** | Removed |
| 11 | Admin gate when the profile lookup returns 500 / malformed JSON / drops the connection | Held (denied) | Held (denied) |
| 12 | Non-admin through the login form | Held | Held |

Regression checks after the fix all pass:
- an admin can log in from a clean IP while another IP is throttled;
- email case and whitespace are normalised;
- every dashboard page renders for an admin;
- same-origin logout works and revokes the token;
- `GET /api/logout` returns 405;
- anonymous requests go to `/login`;
- oversized input is rejected.

Note on #11: the original `try/catch` around the role check *would* fail open
if an exception were thrown. supabase-js returns errors instead of throwing, so
this couldn't be exploited in testing. It is still fixed: every failure now
denies access, and the admin client no longer falls back to the anon key.

## Fixes found by code review (not all covered by dynamic tests)

- **Teacher PIN check:**
  - The staff record was loaded before the tenant check, so one school's
    admin could lock out another school's teachers. The tenant check now runs
    first.
  - The failure counter was read-modify-write, so parallel guesses got around
    the 5-try lockout. An in-process limiter now runs before bcrypt.
  - The reset action wrote `pin_*` column names that the check never reads,
    so a reset never cleared a lockout. Both now use the same columns.
  - `marked_by` is now taken from the verified staff record, not from client
    input.
  - `attendanceType` and the student ID arrays are validated.
- **PIN generation:**
  - PINs came from `Math.random()`; they now use `crypto.randomInt`.
  - "Uniqueness" was checked by bcrypt-comparing every staff PIN across every
    tenant synchronously, which blocked the event loop (DoS). That check is
    removed.
  - bcrypt cost raised from 6 to 10.
- **Signup:**
  - Re-registering an existing email could overwrite that profile and re-run
    school setup. It now checks `identities.length` first.
  - `role` is no longer written to user-editable `user_metadata`.
  - Password policy: at least 8 characters and at most 72 bytes, with a
    letter and a number.
  - Responses are neutral, so they don't reveal whether an account exists.
  - Signup is rate limited.
- **Search:** `searchPeopleAction` built a PostgREST `.or()` filter from raw
  input, which allowed filter injection. Input is now sanitised and the page
  size is capped.
- **Najiki webhook:** the bearer secret was compared with `===`, which leaks
  timing. It now uses a constant-time comparison.
- **`/api/devices/push`:** `.ilike()` let `%` act as a wildcard to probe
  serial numbers. It now uses `.eq()` with validation, and the error doesn't
  say whether a serial is registered.
- **Error messages:** database errors are no longer shown to users.

## Deployment notes

1. Run `supabase_migrations/02_auth_hardening.sql`.
2. If the app is embedded in an iframe (for example AI Studio), set
   `AUTH_COOKIE_SAMESITE=none` and `ALLOW_IFRAME_EMBED=true`.
3. Make sure no RLS policy or `auth_school_id()` trusts `user_metadata`.
4. A test Supabase URL and anon key are still in git history (commit
   `2fb2bd6`). Rotate the key.
5. The rate limiter is per instance. If you scale out, back it with
   Redis/Upstash.
